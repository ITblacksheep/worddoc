### Credit & Thanks
Without these Bloggers this module would not have happened:
 - [Laerte Junior](https://www.simple-talk.com/sql/database-administration/automating-your-sql-server-best-practice-reports-the-document/) 
   Laerte's blog post helped me to create my own add table function, there are lots of similarities between the two functions and full credit goes to Laerte for this function. 
 - [Boe Prox](https://learn-powershell.net/2014/12/31/beginning-with-powershell-and-word/)
   Boe's blog post helped me to work out the basis of working with Powershell and Word, especially how to use [Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word] 
- [Peter MacDonald](https://bitbucket.org/nodkane/) Made commits to script when it was hosted on bitbucket
